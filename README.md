## This is a webpage for my father business
All the page is powered using JavaScript.

I made the **Front-End with React.js, Bootstrap and Material-ui** and the **Back-End with Express**, for the **database I use Atlas MongoDB.**

All the design are made by myself including the logo. The tools that I use are Figma, Photoshop and Illustrator.

I use one external API from google for the map, that you can see in the last section of the page.

*To see the files go to the master branch*
