## This is a webpage for my father business
All the page is powered using JavaScript.

I made the front-end with React.js, Bootstrap and Material-ui and the back-end with Express, for the database I use Atlas MongoDB.

All the design are made by myself including the logo. The tools that I use are Figma, Photoshop and Illustrator.

I use one external API from google for the map, that you can see in the last section of the page.
