## This is a webpage for my father business

Live: https://vidrios-vilardo.herokuapp.com

All the page is powered using JavaScript.

I made the **Front-End with React.js, Bootstrap and Material-ui** and the **Back-End with Express**, for the **database I use Atlas MongoDB.**

All the design are made by myself including the logo. The tools that I use are Figma, Photoshop and Illustrator.

I use the **Google Map API** for the map that is on the "Ubicacion" section

*To see the files go to the master branch*
